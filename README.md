In Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs), you’ll learn the fundamentals of how generative AI works, and how to deploy it in real-world applications.

## Week 1
Generative AI use cases, project lifecycle, and model pre-training

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss model pre-training and the value of continued pre-training vs fine-tuning
- Define the terms Generative AI, large language models, prompt, and describe the transformer architecture that powers LLMs
- Describe the steps in a typical LLM-based, generative AI model lifecycle and discuss the constraining factors that drive decisions at each step of model lifecycle
- Discuss computational challenges during model pre-training and determine how to efficiently reduce memory footprint
- Define the term scaling law and describe the laws that have been discovered for LLMs related to training dataset size, compute budget, inference requirements, and other factors

## Week 2
Fine-tuning and evaluating large language models

### Learning Objectives
- Describe how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets can improve performance on one or more tasks
- Define catastrophic forgetting and explain techniques that can be used to overcome it
- Define the term Parameter-efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
- Explain how PEFT decreases computational cost and overcomes catastrophic forgetting
- Explain how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets can increase LLM performance on one or more

## Week 3
Reinforcement learning and LLM-powered applications

### Learning Objectives
- Describe how RLHF uses human feedback to improve the performance and alignment of large language models
- Explain how data gathered from human labelers is used to train a reward model for RLHF
- Define chain-of-thought prompting and describe how it can be used to improve LLMs reasoning and planning abilities
- Discuss the challenges that LLMs face with knowledge cut-offs, and explain how information retrieval and augmentation techniques can overcome these challenges
